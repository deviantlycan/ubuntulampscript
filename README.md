# Ubuntu LAMP Script

This is a simple shell script that will install necessary components of a LAMP server as well as other useful utilities to a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 LTS instance.
This has been tested on a clean install of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS locally, as well as on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute instance that was created with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and the GCP compute default Compute configuration of Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch).

## Instructions
In a command terminal run these commands

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deviantlycan/ubuntulampscript/master/lampInstall.sh -O- | tr -d '\r' > lampInstall.sh
    chmod 0755 lampInstall.sh
    sudo ./lampInstall.sh

# IMPORTANT!
The MySQL root password is set to "rootpass" and needs to be reset with the command

    mysqladmin -u root password newpasswordhere

## Testing
Once installation is complete, you should be able to do the following to test your installation:

See the default Apache page
http://localhost/

See the phpMyAdmin login
http://localhost/phpmyadmin/

See the PHP test page
http://localhost/testphp.php

(This page was generated by the script and lives in the path /var/www/html/testphp.php and should be deleted from any non test or development system)
